Technical Assessment Instructions

A client wants to gain insights into their customers attributes and transactions to help improve customer retention and overall revenue. The client has asked you to evaluate if their data warehouse contains enough data to perform analyses examining customers attributes and transactions to drive business decisions. The client has emailed you their main 3 datasets (referrals.csv, transactions.csv, demographics.csv) and a json file (subscription_prices.json) with subscription price points.

Your first task is to explore the fictive datasets (approx. 1 hour), so that you would be able to provide the client with an assessment of what data they have available in these 4 files, and whether the datasets they provided are fit for purpose. You should use Python, SQL, or R to explore the data.

When you have finalized your code, please send us:

--A csv with data compiled from all 4 data sources 

--Please send us your code so that we can execute and evaluate your code in one of the following ways: python, jupyter notebook, BigQuery(SQL), or sqlite3(if using SQL within python/jupyter) or R. 

--Please make sure any packages used are defined, and open source so that we can replicate your code. Make sure to include a recommendation to the client in your file/notebook

*You will only be able to make your submission for both files once using the email form*


Good to know:

If you proceed to the final stage of the interview process, you will be asked to execute an analysis on this dataset, and present your findings in a case evaluation. (edited)
